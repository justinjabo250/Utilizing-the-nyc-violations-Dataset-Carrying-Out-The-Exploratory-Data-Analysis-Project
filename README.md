# Utilizing-the-nyc-violations-Dataset-Carrying-Out-The-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project

### Using the nyc-violations dataset, I carried out the Exploratory Data Analysis Project with the goal of creating an outstanding and incredible report using Jupyter Notebook that would highlight the insights discovered inside the dataset. As a result, the project will include significant visualizations that demonstrate patterns and provide insights to assist managers and stakeholders in making well-informed decisions based on data.


**Thus, we will be concentrating on providing answers to business-related queries in order to develop a feasible solution.**

**The query will be as follows: by Let's assume that tickets can be dismissed if the license plate, state, and/or street name are present, but the make of automobile is not required, using the same nyc-ticket-violation dataset. Rows lacking one or more of these should be removed. What number of rows are there still? How much money would the city lose from this, assuming a $100 ticket price?**
